Among the challenges that have been identified by the SiG, dealing with latency issues and network split brains is important for most OpenStack services.</p>\r\n<p>In this presentation, we focus on how they impact the Keystone Identity Service. Keystone offers different deployment approaches, from a centralized one, to a federation, as well as a replication using database clustering. By varying the number of regions and latency between those regions, we compare the following deployments:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>One centralized Keystone handling requests of all regions</li>\r\n<li>A replicated Keystone using Galera Cluster to synchronize databases in the different regions</li>\r\n<li>A replicated Keystone leveraging the NewSQL CockroachDB database</li>\r\n<li>A federated Keystone</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We present the methodology, results and identification of possible improvements towards a more decentralized management of the OpenStack services.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
